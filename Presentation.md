#üìå-- Pacman Codebase Overview
This code implements a Pac-Man-inspired game in C++ with OpenGL, featuring a maze, food items, and dynamic monster characters.
Players control Pac-Man using keyboard inputs (W, A, S, D) while avoiding collisions with randomly moving monsters.
The game includes clear win conditions (collecting all food items) and lose conditions (collision with monsters).
It uses efficient rendering techniques, including trigonometric calculations for drawing circular characters and a bitmap system to represent obstacles in the maze.
The code is modular, making it easy to extend and refine for enhanced gameplay features like animations, sound effects, or AI-driven monster behavior.

‚ùì Questions & Answers
1. What is the Purpose of this Project?
   The Pac-Man game project aims to recreate the classic gameplay experience using C++ and OpenGL. It demonstrates fundamental game development principles:
   - Visual rendering of a maze and characters.
   - Handling player input for controlling Pac-Man.
   - Introducing randomness and unpredictability through monster behavior.
   - Establishing win/lose conditions for an engaging gameplay loop.
  
2. What are the Core Features of the Game?
   i. Monster:
      Four Monster with random movement make the game challenging.
   ii. Points system:
       Players collect food scattered across the maze, earning points.
   iii. Win and Loses status:
